# Frontend Setup

## Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a `.env` file in this directory if you need to customize the API URL:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## Starting the Development Server

```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on port 3000.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
